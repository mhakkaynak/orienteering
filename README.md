#Orienteering Mobile App

>This project is Kocaeli University Computer Engineering graduation project.

&nbsp;The orienteering mobile application helps the competitors to follow the orienteering competitions and download the maps to be used during the competition. In addition, during the competition, it helps the competitors to follow the routes and find the places thanks to the phones with GPS feature. Thanks to this application, competitors can instantly find out where they are on the map and where they should go during the competition.

&nbsp;At the end of each competition, the competitors can see the leaderboard and their performance throughout the competition. In this way, they can show higher performance in the next competitions they will participate in.

&nbsp;In addition, our mobile application will also be available for indoor use. In other words, the user will have the indoor map by uploading a picture of the sketch of a closed place to the mobile application. After this process, the user can create control points by marking the desired locations.
